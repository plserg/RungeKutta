Collection of header-only files with implementation of 2nd and 4th order stabilized Runge-Kutta methods.
Possible use: 
include "rkc.hpp" or "rock4.hpp", define rhs_function(t,u,du_dt) which maps du/dt = rhs(t,u) 
and call appropriate solving method:

rk::rkc_solve(neqn,
                0.0,
                u0,    
                t_end,
                h0,
                rhs_function,
                u_end,
                tol, tol );

to obtain the solution u_end(t_end)
